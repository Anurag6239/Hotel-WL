              <img src="./img/person-1.jpg" alt="jeeny">
              <p>I stayed there on 28th & 29th night in Luxury grand sea view on 4th floor and had requested
                   for my husbands birthday celebration. What can we say my god when we entered the room it 
                   was decorated so beautifully that we both were surpised also food , hospitality and 
                   everything was perfect. Staying in HWL with sea view was my dream since years and 
                   housekeeping teamâ€™s (Mr. Chandrakant) efforts were cherry on the cake. Right from Security 
                   to housekeeping every department 10/10 and works very efeciently.
                Thank you from bottom of our heart.
                Stay safe and healthy</p>
